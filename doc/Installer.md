# Install via Installer

Installation using the installer is downright easy and straightforward:

1. Download the bundle installer [here](https://github.com/CypaxNET/VFD-Studio2/releases).

2. Execute the downloaded *vfdstudio-installer_2-x-y-z.exe* (*2-x-y-z* being the version of the bundle).

3. Decide whether to autostart VFD-Studio and to add it to the Windows start menu:
   
   <img title="" src="file:///E:/Projekte/VFD-Studio2/git/doc/install_options.png" alt="install_options.png" width="341">

4. Chose the destination folder where to install VFD-Studio on a hard drive:
   
   <img title="" src="file:///E:/Projekte/VFD-Studio2/git/doc/install_path.png" alt="install_path.png" width="341">

5. At the end of the installation you will be asked whether or not to start VFD-Studio now:
   
   <img title="" src="file:///E:/Projekte/VFD-Studio2/git/doc/install_finish.png" alt="install_finish.png" width="340">

Note: The installer will **not** overwrite existing settings from a previous installation. So you don't need to worry about having to reconfigure your display again ðŸ˜‰
Although not required, you might consider to <mark>uninstall </mark>a previous installation of VFD-Studio 2 prior installation into the same destination folder.
